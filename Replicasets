Replicasets:
Where does restart happen â€” container or pod?

ðŸ‘‰ The restartPolicy applies to the containers inside the pod.

âœ… If a container crashes or exits, the kubelet (on the node) will try to restart that container based on the podâ€™s restartPolicy.

âœ… The pod itself is not recreated or restarted by kubelet.

    The pod object stays as-is.

    The pod's status might show CrashLoopBackOff, but the pod definition doesn't change or move.



caling a ReplicaSet

A ReplicaSet can be easily scaled up or down by simply updating the .spec.replicas field. The ReplicaSet controller ensures that a desired number of Pods with a matching label selector are available and operational.

When scaling down, the ReplicaSet controller chooses which pods to delete by sorting the available pods to prioritize scaling down pods based on the following general algorithm:

    Pending (and unschedulable) pods are scaled down first
    If controller.kubernetes.io/pod-deletion-cost annotation is set, then the pod with the lower value will come first.
    Pods on nodes with more replicas come before pods on nodes with fewer replicas.
    If the pods' creation times differ, the pod that was created more recently comes before the older pod (the creation times are bucketed on an integer log scale).
